      To,</br>
      Our Forgotten Hero</br>
      Dear Netaji,</br>
      Seventy-three years after India’s independence, the only tribute I can pay on is to unconditionally apologise for failing you and your ideology.</br>
      You worked tirelessly all your life for Hindu-Muslim unity, but we are turning each and every issue into a weapon to brutalise it.</br>
      You believed in fair politics, but, instead of following what you stood for, we have been creating conspiracy theories, one after the other, on your death for political gains.</br>
      You concluded that love is the essence of the Universe and is the essential principle in human life, but we have established factories that manufacture and circulate hate day and night.</br>
      And, last but not least…</br>
      Jai Hind</br>
      </br>
      Although the death of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose is a mystery but he is still <span style="color:#192965; font-weight:bold;">AMAR</span> in the heart of millions of Indians.

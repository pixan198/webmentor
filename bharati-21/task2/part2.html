						<p>Hermoine Jean Granger is a fictional character from the famous Harry Potter novel series by J.K. Rowling</p>

				<p class="intro">Hermione Granger was never written to be given away as pretty, compassionate and empathetic, like every other woman in the society is described and expected to be. Her character was written to be a strong, smart, beautiful (not pretty) and an intellectual woman with honest and righteous principles.</p>
				<div class="list one">
					<p class="list-head one">Why Hermione and what does her character provide?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Described as "The brightest witch of her age", she has an intellect that surpasses everybody else's</li>
						<li>A solid nerd who repeatedly saves lives and tells the reader subtly that "Knowledge is a wepaon and reading can save your life"</li>
						<li>Hermoine's motto : <span>When in doubt, go to the library</span></li>
						<li>An upright believer that everyone should be treated equally, no matter where and who they are born as</li>
						<li>An inspiring, headstrong woman with sheer willingness to do what she believed was right, despite being bullied for "not being woman enough" or for being a "know-it-all"</li>
						<li>A feminist and a constant reminder that a woman can be whoever or whataver she wants to be</li>
						<li>"Seek what matters to you and pursue it with passion". Her passion and thirst for knowledge is inspires and motivates to do and be better</li>
						<li>Be yourself and do what your heart says even if people judge you for not fitting social norms. Nothing shouls stop you from being exceptional</li>
						<li>A good, dutiful and a loyal friend who quotes <span>Books and cleverness! There are more important things like friendship and bravery!</span></li>

					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="list two">
					<p class="intro">Although merely a fictional character, I've been deeply influenced by her ever since I started reading the first book.</p>
				</p>
					<li>I realised how important it is to work tirelessly for self goals from this character. I also understood the significance of being myself and not worrying about being judged.</li>
					<li>Very much like Hermoine who was bullied for being intelligent, I have been laughed at as well. It is then I learnt from her to stand up to bullies and the importance of education in one's life.</li>
					<li>My foundational opinions, ideals and thoughts about feminism was also something I equipped from this strong independent female character.</li>
					<li>I have always considered books as my best friend which is again a trait I developed after I read the books.</li>
					<li>Hermione Granger motivated and inspired me to be better and put forth my best self whenever I felt dominated by the presence of male competition around me.</li>

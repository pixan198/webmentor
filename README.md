## Task 2 - CSS

This task is divided into two parts, doing both is optional, you can do both also.

### Part 1

## Task 3

Build a landing page. It can be your portfolio website, or company landing page.

I would recommend that you guys design your own portfolio website during this week, but in case you want a ready made design you wish to work on, you can see a sample design here - [Task 3 Template (PSD)](./task3_template/README.md)

## Task 4

The agenda for week 4 is JavaScript and DOM manipulation, so you can feel free to make some basic applications according to your innovative ideas.

One basic idea can be a countdown timer -

    <p id = "passage">WHEN I was an undergraduate at MIT I loved it. I thought it was a great place, and I wanted to go to graduate school there too, of course.
    But when I went to Professor Slater and told him of my intentions, he said, 'We won't let you in here'. I said, 'What?'
Slater asked, 'why do you think you should go to graduate school at MIT?'
Because MIT is the best Science school in the country'.
'You think that?'
'yeah'.
'That's why you should go to some other school. You should find out how the rest of the world is'.</p>

      The so called Lean Programmer fills enthusiasm and motivation in every single person out there who attends his
      webinar
      or follows him. He does all this just to get satisfaction. I like to follow him because,
      I see myself doing all the stuffs that he is doing right now. I just want to thank him by writing this tribute to
      him. I hope he never stops motivating others.I wish to become a great programmer like him and contribute to the
      society as well.
